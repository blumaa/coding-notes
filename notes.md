## Evaluation and Assessment

### Tool for Improving work flow through a project.

1. Create a rubric together that defines a scale or spectrum.
   1. e.g. Excellent work flow vs. not so good working flow
   2. Could have three through ten points.
      1. The number of points is defined during the creation of the tool.
      2. You come up with examples of what you want to strive towards vs what you want to avoid
      3. What do these things look like? Feel like? Sound like? etc.
2. Go through a project, keeping this scale or spectrum in mind.
3. After the project, use the tool with your partner or group. Everyone fills out a rubric for their self.
   1. How well did your team do this time? What makes you say that?
   2. What can be improved next time?
      1. Make concrete points. Does this change the way the rubric is designed? Do you need to adjust the rubric in order to tune into a different outcome? What’s not working or useless from the rubric?
